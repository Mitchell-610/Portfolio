# Portfolio
My portfolio
If you need to sample a potential employee's previous work
When you load my portfolio
You are then presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
When you click one of the links in the navigation
My amazing portfolio scrolls to the corresponding section
You are then presented with the my first application
My latest application's image will be larger in size than the others
Then you click on the images of the applications
You are then taken to that deployed application
When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
You are then presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
