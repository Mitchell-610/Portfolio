                My name is Mitchell Heit. I'm a aspiring softwear developer. I am currently enrolled in the UCF
                coding bootcamp and expect to pass with flying colors. My old passion was working on high end
                cars. Even though I loved it, I knew I had so much more potential. I've always loved the
                technical side of things. As a child, I used to take things apart just to see how it works. Then
                I stumbled accross coding and at that second I knew I found my purpose. What I was supposed to
                be doing, something that made me genuinely happy. I spend my days hanging out with my two
                wonderful dogs, and using hobby grade RC cars outside of coding of course.
